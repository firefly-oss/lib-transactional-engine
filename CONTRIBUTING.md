## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow standard Java coding conventions with some specific preferences:

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- **Comments**: Use Javadoc for public APIs

### Code Formatting

We use Maven Checkstyle plugin for code formatting:

```bash
# Check code style
mvn checkstyle:check

# Auto-format code (if formatter is configured)
mvn spotless:apply
```

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: All new code must have unit tests with >80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for new features
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test method names
- **Test Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example test:
```java
@Test
public void shouldExecuteSagaSuccessfullyWhenAllStepsComplete() {
    // Arrange
    var saga = createTestSaga();
    var inputs = StepInputs.of("orderId", "12345");
    
    // Act
    var result = sagaEngine.execute(saga, inputs).block();
    
    // Assert
    assertThat(result.isSuccess()).isTrue();
    assertThat(result.getSteps()).hasSize(3);
}
```

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Code Documentation**: Use Javadoc for public APIs
- **README Updates**: Update relevant README files for new features
- **User Documentation**: Add or update user-facing documentation in `docs/`
- **Changelog**: Add entries to CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. **Check Documentation**: Review the documentation for solutions
3. **Test with Latest Version**: Ensure you're using the latest version

### Issue Templates
